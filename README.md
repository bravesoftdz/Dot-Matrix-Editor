# Dot matrix editor

This is a simple editor for LED matrix project.
  * Create Arduino source code for MAX7219 module (LED matrix).
  * Arduino source code, which created by this, will needs an external library "MAX7219.h" and "MAX7219.cpp". You can find it in the Arduino folder of this repository.  Copy those files into Arduino libraries folder or same folder as the generated LED matrix code.
